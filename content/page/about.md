I'm a software engineer who suffers from [Ornithophobia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ornithophobia). I hate achieving something in a stupid way so I'm also a perfectionist who have minor Mysophobia.

I work at a company which mainly focus on digital advertising. Yep, the things you hate when you're browing the internet. This is my first job and I've been working here since March 2017.

Currently I'm working on building a new DSP (Demand Side Platform).

I'm a Taiwanese so there will be some Chinese articles if I don't know how to properly express them in English.
